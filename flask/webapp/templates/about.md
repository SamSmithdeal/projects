## About Spotlight

Live events are the ultimate test of coordination.
If performers, event organizers, and venue owners don't communicate effectively, the fan experience
and economic success of a show or tour may be negativly impacted.
Spotlight seeks to improve event and tour operations by providing a single platform for event organizers, venue owners,
and performers to plan and execute on their vision.
Users will finally beable to have access to all necessary information and the ability to propose events all in one spot!
Organizers can quickly identify available venues and artists, performers can review and accept event offers,
as well as use the platform as their own personal schedule manager.
Venue owners can accept events and edited data pertaining to thier venues to ensure that their locations are used efficiently.
After events, sales and attendance data provided by our system will help stakeholders develop future events and
allow performers to find the right venue for their event.
